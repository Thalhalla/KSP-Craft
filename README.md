## Ship descriptions

* Mercury - early tech tree craft capable of getting a kerbin to a decent orbit and then de-orbit to a specific survey spot on Kerbin
* CheapOrbit - a very cheap way to get into orbit, it can be even done with less but then you donâ€™t have a lot of fuel for picking your de-orbit spot
* ResQ - cheapest single column ship I could make to rescue a stranded kerbal in orbit
* Duna Voyager - All stock ship for traveling to Duna. Has shroud which covers lander. Requires removing the lander and attaching to front of command pod in orbit around Kerbin.
* NKRV 1+L2 - Near Kerbin Rescue Vehicle Mk.1 with Launcher Mk.2: designed to rescue kerbins floating around kerbin
* MunExplorerHabitat1+L1 - An early tech Mun base with launcher. Minimal dV for maneuvering.

* Sputnik --my largest dV to date with over 26k in dV, not really the most efficient design ever, but the first couple of stages are glorious with tons of fire and smoke to satisfy any pyro
