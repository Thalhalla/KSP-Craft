KSP-Craft

Craft files from Kerbal Space Program

Mercury - early tech tree craft capable of getting a kerbin to a decent orbit and then de-orbit to a specific survey spot on Kerbin
CheapOrbit - a very cheap way to get into orbit, it can be even done with less but then you donâ€™t have a lot of fuel for picking your de-orbit spot
ResQ - cheapest single column ship I could make to rescue a stranded kerbal in orbit
